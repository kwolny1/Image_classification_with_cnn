# Image_classification_with_cnn
Comparison between ResNet-50, EfficientNetV2, ConvNeXt. 

The primary objective of this project was to compare the performance of several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures on the image classification task using the CINIC-10 dataset. Beyond simple benchmarking, we focused on understanding how key training components (hyperparameters, data augmentations, few-shot learning, and model ensembling) impact overall model performance in practice. We used these three models:

- ResNet (ResNet-50),
- EfficientNetV2,
- ConvNeXt.

All models were initialized with pretrained ImageNet weights and fine-tuned using the TensorFlow framework within the Google Colab environment.
